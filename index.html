    <h1> Assignment 1 </h1>

    <p> The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.
